#### Plan for the two-weeks on-boarding training

* The purpose of this repository is too make the training more immersive and updated with the latest technologies and tutorials and more straight forward providing a clear path to follow.
* This is not an enforced path, it will likely depend on your first project at the company
* All the resources are free or are from CodeSchool
* At the end of your coop term feel free to add, update or remove resources.
